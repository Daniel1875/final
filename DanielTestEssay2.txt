In the evening of July 5 2019 I entered Urumqi railway station for departure deep into Xinjiang  Immediately I found the internet completely unusable I couldnt even open the website to apply to Bard College at Simons Rock For the entire evening almost everyone stared at their phones futilely trying to get some information Passengers of the Han people sit together and so did the Uyghur but stayed away from each other They looked around nervously no talking no smiling This coincided with the Urumqi Incident ten years ago when numerous people mostly Han elders women and children were brutally killed with knives My parents planned this trip to show me Chinas history and reality They stayed awake looking stern and vigilant This intense uneasiness could be felt everywhere train stations hotels and crossroads The Uyghur were treated differently While the security officers didnt scrutinize our belongings excessively they tediously searched and questioned the Uyghur Every few hours on the highway we would stop by a security checkpoint lower the windows take off our glasses and look at a camera for a few seconds There was no need to show our ID cards For the first time I saw facial recognition technology in action to track where everyone is and was Even today the most advanced facial recognition software I find in the US recognized my CS professor as Donald Trump We went on the train off Xinjiang with a locallygrown cantaloupe delicious but with hard skin Passengers were not allowed to carry knives but having travelled around China my father knew knives can always be borrowed to cut fruits However the train crew told him that in Xinjiang the regulations on knives is everywhere Fortunately my father who is familiar with engineering material found a plastic knife He carefully cut the cantaloupe into pieces and shared it and our travel experiences with other passengers A man whose brother lives in Xinjiang told us in restaurants and other places alike cleavers had to be chained in the kitchen so they couldnt be removed Then he whispered that every morning the Xinjiang people who didnt attend the Flag Raising Ceremony were sent to the learning camp for 4 months and couldnt make money the entire year The cold climate meant the business season only lasts half year Nobody talks about it in Xinjiang I tried to talk with a Uyghur driver about local peoples lives but he answered very little He reluctantly refused my fathers tip said this exceeded our contract and did not conform to their peoples customs Wearing wornout clothing he kept his cold dignity and politeness I realized why in the crowded tourist sites there are almost no Uyghur tourists In my school even though I was almost the poorest and used a phone costing less than 100 dollars I never felt I belong to any depressed class yet somewhere in my homeland I was seemingly the privileged It was like Borg cubes in the stone age I saw people deprived of the basic tools necessary for daily life and at the same time monitored and controlled by highly advanced AI technology which shouldve been used to find and liberate women and children abducted and sold off in China I wonder if the engineers involved are aware of what they did It reminds me of Adolf Eichmann and the banality of evil while my mind was filled with computer science and the Star Trek Perhaps the US college students refusing to work for certain hightech companies underwent serious moral considerations The BCSR motto  Identify and solve the worlds biggest problems  seems like mission impossible A week later my mother wakes me up in the morning with a kiss and informed me that I was admitted to BCSR with an unimaginably generous financial aid At that moment I knew I belonged to the entire world
